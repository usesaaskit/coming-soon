Have you ever dreamed of building your own app or online service, but got scared off by how much it might cost? You're not alone. Many great ideas never see the light of day because of the high costs involved in making them a reality. But what if there was a way to bring your ideas to life without breaking the bank? Enter MVPKit.

## Why is Building Products So Expensive?
Building a product from scratch involves a lot. You have to research, plan, design, code, test, and fix a bunch of stuff before your idea can become something people use. This process needs lots of time, a team of skilled people, and a fair bit of money for tools and services. And the costs keep climbing if you want to add more features or reach more users.

## The Biggest Money Drains
* Starting from Zero: Starting with a blank slate means a lot of work before anything looks like a product.
* Adding Too Many Features: It's tempting to add lots of cool features, but each one costs time and money.
* Hiring a Big Team: Skilled developers and designers don't come cheap.
* Fixing Mistakes: Finding and fixing issues can eat up your budget fast.
