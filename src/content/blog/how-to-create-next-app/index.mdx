The [AHA Programming Principle](/blog/aha-programming) stands for "Avoid Hasty
Abstraction." I have specific feelings about how this applies to writing
maintainable tests. Most of the tests that I've seen in the wild have been
wildly on one side of the spectrum of abstraction: ANA (Absolutely No
Abstraction), or completely DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). (I made up ANA just
now).
